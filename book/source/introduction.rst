Introduction
======================

Prerequisites
----------------

#.  It is helpful to have a working Python interpreter open in another 
    window while you read this.


How To Read This Text
-----------------------

#.  When you see text that begins with 3 chevrons like this::

        >>> 'some thing'

    enter it in into your ``Python`` interpreter (**without the chevrons**),
    exactly as written.

#.  Things that look like ``this`` are "computery".

#.  **boldface** implies a **definition** or **vocabulary term**
